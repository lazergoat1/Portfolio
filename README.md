Single Realm is an in progress 2D RPG which takes inspiration from Realm of the Mad God. In the future the game will have a procedurally generated map, an inventory system, multiple enemy types, and possibly npc interactions.

Swing is a small game where the player tries to swing a ball around objects to get higher and stay away from the laser. Swing is my first finished Unity game. The art, sound, music, code, and design was all done by me.
