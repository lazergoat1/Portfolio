Swing is a small game where the player tries to swing a ball around objects to get higher and stay away from the laser. Swing is my first finished Unity game. The art, sound, music, code, and design was all done by me.

City Builder is a Roblox game that I made over the summer. I had planned to make a full fledged city builder but ended up stopping with a couple different building types and money generation. I coded, modeled, and designed the game, the UI art assets are made by Kenny Game Assets.
