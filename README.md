# About Me
##

I'm a 18 year old high school senior and game developer living in Topanga California. I am going to be attending DigiPen Institute of Technology in the fall to pursue my passion for game development.

I find the most interesting part of game development to be creating worlds that the player can explore and the character controller that they use to explore them. I also really enjoy learning new concepts and seeing the game come to life as I implement them. My passion for seeing game worlds come to life has led me to create many small projects over the past year and teach myself how to use multiple game engines and how to code in both C# and Lua. Currently I am working on making a prototype for a procedurally generated rpg in Unity which I hope to have finished by graduation in May. 

Alongside my passion for game development I like to play guitar, make music, exercise, play video games, and talk to friends. 

I am currently looking for some work experience and would be interested in a game development or software development internship or job.

** IN PROGRESS **

Single Realm is an in-progress 2D RPG that takes inspiration from Realm of the Mad God. Currently, you can fight enemies to gain XP and explore the games endless procedurally generated map. The game has a procedural generation system that generates a new map every time you create a new world and a save and load system which allows your progress and world to be saved. In the future, it will have an inventory system and multiple enemy types.

Inventory Crafting Demo is a crafting and inventory system demo for a survival game I was planning on making a couple of months ago. In it, you can collect resources and use them to craft items that allow you to mine rocks and cut down trees.

Swing is a small game where the player tries to swing a ball around objects to get higher and stay away from the laser. Swing is my first finished Unity game. I designed the game, coded it, and created the art, sound effects, and music.

## Character Controllers

Character controllers contains customizable third-person and first-person controllers which allow the player to use the mouse and WASD keys to control the movement of the character. I developed this a couple of months ago as a tool I could use for my future projects.

City Builder is a Roblox game that I made over the summer. In the game, you place buildings that generate money and then upgrade them to generate more money. I had planned to make a full-fledged city builder but ended up stopping with a couple of different building types and money generation. I coded, modeled, and designed the game, the UI art assets are made by Kenny Game Assets.
